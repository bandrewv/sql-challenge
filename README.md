# Week 9 HW Assignment - SQL-Challenge

## Data Engineering
* After reviewing the tables in each of the attached .csv files, I visted genmymodel.com to set up an [ERD](/EmployeeSQL/SQL_Challenge_Schema_Diagram.jpeg) and generate a schema for my relational database.

* I generated the table schema based on the ERD model from genmymodel.com generation. I had to make a few changes to the order of the tables, but the final table schema can be found [here](/EmployeeSQL/sql-challenge-schema-file.sql).

## Data Analysis
* Upon completeing the table setup, I wrote all of my SQL queries [here](/EmployeeSQL/sql-challenge-queries-file.sql). Contained within the file are queries for each of the 8 items in the Data Analysis section in the assignment README file.
